# WebApplicationRSS
It's a simple RSS Feed with ASP.NET Core Web API implemented wit VS2019 with a basic template of an ASP.NET Core web empty template,
and where the code was saw in the [article](https://referbruv.com/blog/posts/creating-a-simple-rss-feed-with-aspnet-core-web-api).

**Note 1:** interesting way aslo was to see how use ngrok to expose the local web app.

**Note 2:** i also saw  a good tool [CliWrap](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap) well described in this [article](https://www.twilio.com/blog/integrate-ngrok-into-aspdotnet-core-startup-and-automatically-update-your-webhook-urls)
and where a good video can be watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Ucw3Fflmo.)
